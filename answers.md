# Week 12: Chromosal organization through loop extrusion

## General idea

This paper...

## Question 1: Chromatin conformation capture techniques

### How do they work in principle?

### What are the data they produce? How are these data represented in the papers?

### On what genomic length scale are the structures of interest?

## Quesetion 2: Topologically associated domains (TADs)

### What are TADs? What features do they have in contact maps?

### TADs are tranditionally thought of as static? What evidence is presented against that view?

## Question 3: Simulation model in one dimension

### Describe the 1D model of loop extrusion

### How are loops initiated? How do boundary elements define domains?

### What aspects of the problem can be described in 1D, which ones require 3D?

## Question 4: Simulation model in 3D

### What are the elementary units of the 3D model?

### How do LEF affect the polymer dynamics?

### What are the important parameters of the model?

## Question 5: TADs

### How does processivity and separation affect the contact maps and fit to the data?

### How does separation between LEFs affect the results?

### What is the loop coverage and the independent loop size in these regimes?

## Question 6: Corner peaks, loops and TADs

### Corner peaks seem to be an optional feature of TADs. What is their origin and interpretation?

### What parameters tend to produce more pronounced corner peaks?

### What features of TADs are missing in model with permanent loops?

## Question 7: The role of boundary elements (BE)

### BEs are not physical boundaries but stopping point for LEFs. How does this result in domains?

### What is the evidence for CTCF as boundary element?

### What evidence for directional BEs do they discuss?

## Question 8: Large scale organization

### What is the interpretation of the characteristic checkerboard pattern?

### What are the proposed mechanisms for this organization?

### How do they differ? Equilibrium/non-equilibrium? ATP dependent or not?
