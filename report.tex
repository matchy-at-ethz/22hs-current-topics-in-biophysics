% the most important part it to explain

%  * what the general question is that is being addressed. that will include some general context on chromosome conformations and chromatin accessibility.
%  * how we learn about chromatin conformations (Hi-C etc)
%  * a discussion of the author's approach, the model, and the results.
%  * what the strength and weaknesses of the model are, what is left unexplained
%  * What could be done next? What has been done since?
